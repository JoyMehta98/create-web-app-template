# React Template

Create a React template project with well known design packages `Material-UI` and `Ant Design`

Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux. Creates all the boilerplate code along with husky, prettier, commit-lint and a sample unit test configured so that you can focus on the application logic.

# Usage

```
npx create-react-template my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

You can also install create-react-template globally and use it to create a template anywhere in your system.

After running npm start, go to http://localhost:3000 to see a simple page(3000 here being the port number, you can change this in the .env file) You should see `Dashboard` text and start implementing in the same pattern.
